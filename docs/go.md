# Whay Go

## Problem description

## Go characters

Go has simple syntax, and easy to understand. It has well embedded memory management and concurrency handling features. Which reduce developing overhead and improve software engineers productivity.

Go has well supports of build-in functionality, such as 'goroutines' for concurrency and threadlike behavior. Also it has go support in packages. Which makes it more convenient than other scripting language.

Go less complex than other compiled languages.

Go binaries run more slowly than C, but much more fast than other language like Javascript, python, ruby. However, due to other limitation, go performances similar as C in most of project.

Go executables created with go toolchain is independent to OS. Which makes it portable to multiple platforms.

Go has good interoperability, go program can talk to C lib, or make native system calls.

## Where Go lang works best

- **Distributed networked service**: Go has native concurrency features `goroutines` and `channel`, which makes APIs, web servers more performance.

- **Cloud-native development**: Go has high degree of portability. Which is suitable for multiple OS devolopment. e.g. `kubernetes` and `Docker`

- **Stand-alone tools**: Go has abundant of packages supports, and also it's very lightweight and simple to program.

## Go lang limitations

Go seek for simplicity, which sacraficed standardization of coding management. Go does not inlcude generics, which makes go lang is not that well structured by functions.

Go use statically compiiles, which makes it's binary big since everything needed at runtime is included.
